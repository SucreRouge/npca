## Our primary work
We implemnt the experiments presented in the paper Nonlinear Component Analysis as a Kernel Eigenvalue Problem by Bernhard Schölkopf, Alexander Smola, Klaus-Robert Müller. Also, we write our own example on Kernel PCA. In this regard, you can read our report and our presentation slides.

## Dependencies
In order to run the experiments, make sure you have all dependencies installed
- matplotlib (>= 2.0.0)
- scipy (>=0.19.0)
- numpy (>=1.12.1)
- sklearn (>=0.0)

You can install them by typing\\

`pip3 install 'whatever you need'`

The prgramming languages we use are Python and MATLAB. If you do not have access to MATLAB on your laptop. We advise you to install `Octave` instead. You can refer to [this](https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/download.html) webpage for installing.

## Running the experiments
In the paper, there are three major experiments:
- Toy example: 4 Polynomial
- Character Recognition (USPS Dataset)
